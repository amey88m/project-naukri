# project mynkri

# This is simple project for `jobs searching`.

# I used here bootstrap for responsiveness & sass related frame.

# No framework is used for js. All js are writes from scratch.

# How it works?

----------------
I have created 
1) candidate signup & login pg  
   http://127.0.0.1/project_naukri/candidate-signup
   http://127.0.0.1/project_naukri/login
2) employer signup & login pg  
   http://127.0.0.1/project_naukri/empl-signup
   http://127.0.0.1/project_naukri/empl-login
3) Admin panel

1) candidate: after signup, candidate can login with their respective email & password. They will enter into their profile page where they can check for latest jobs, search for jobs, apply on it.
one more interesting view is they can check available jobs with respective HR`s info and candidate can directly contact to HR from email/phone.

2) Employer: after signup, employer will login and enter into their Admin panel. Once they reached to the admin panel they have to create a their own 'HR' team.
One interesting feature in it is they can check all HR's activity through 'birdview tab'.
`Hr team` cann't remain login if their team head gets logoff.
